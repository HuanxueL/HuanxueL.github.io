      "description": "Developed a lightweight multimodal fusion framework integrating FinBERT-based news sentiment features, TCN-encoded financial time-series signals, and a correlation-enhanced technical indicator module for stock direction prediction. Constructed and evaluated the model on 84K aligned news–price samples from AAPL, MSFT, AMZN, and META under strict chronological splits. Benchmarked against LSTM, GRU, TCN, XGBoost, and LightGBM to validate performance improvements and robustness.",

Fine-tuned FinBERT for sentiment extraction and integrated sentiment signals into Random Forest models to evaluate predictive performance. Designed controlled experiments comparing social media-only, news-only, and combined feature sets to analyze their relative contribution to forecasting accuracy.",
